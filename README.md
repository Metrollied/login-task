# login-task
Hello and welcome to my Login Application. This application uses NodeJS on the backend and React on the frontend.

# Warning

This repo publicly displays MongoDB and authentication token information. This is, of course, bad practice, and very unsafe. However, it is neccessary in this case for the app to be used locally. To make the app safer I recommend you create a free MongoDB database and use that instead, and use dotenv to securely hide the authorisation token and MongoDB information.

# Getting Started

First, install the repo locally in the usual way, through SSH  
` git@github.com:Metrollied/login-task.git `  

HTTPS  
` https://github.com/Metrollied/login-task.git `  

Or by downloading the files directly.

Then, load up your terminal in the root directory and enter the following commands:

```
cd Node/   
npm install  
npm run install-react-dependencies  
```
This will install the dependencies for Node and React.

Then, run  
` npm run start-app `  

This will start the Node server on port 5000 and the React frontend on port 3000.

Happy coding!
